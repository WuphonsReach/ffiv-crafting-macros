# Level 18

At level 18, you gain "Standard Touch", plus you picked up "Waste Not" and "Veneration" at level 15.  This gives a boost in being able to get a HQ result from your macros without needing all input materials as HQ.  With the changes in Endwalker, you will likely find it a lot easier to get HQ results without using any HQ materials.

Make sure that you are improving your primary/secondary weapons as you go through the levels.  They have a large impact on your ability to get to 100% progress/quality.  Melding and HQ equipment is optional.

## L18/D70 CP182 4.5x

This macro could have the last "Standard Touch" removed if you need a macro that is capable of making a durability 60 recipe. You might have trouble getting 100% HQ by doing so, but maybe there's a recipe where you don't have 70 durability to play with.  You may have to feed in some HQ materials to achieve 100% HQ results if you remove the last "Standard Touch".
