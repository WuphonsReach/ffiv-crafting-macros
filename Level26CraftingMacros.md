# Level 26

At level 26, you gain "Innovation" which is a big boost (+50%) to the amount of quality gain you get per round. At this level you should have around 260-280 CP (maybe as much as 300).

## L26/D55 CP256 4.5x

There's room here to add one more "Basic Synthesis" to the end to use 65 durability, but increase the progress to a 5.5x multiplier.  Or you could add one more "Basic Touch" if you have another 15 CP above the required 256 CP.
