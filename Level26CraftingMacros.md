# Level 26

At level 26, you gain "Innovation" which is a big boost (+50%) to the amount of quality gain you get per round. At this level you should have around 260-280 CP (maybe as much as 300).

From here until level 50, the "L26/D55 CP256 4.5x" is going to be your primary macro.  I don't recommend trying to make any recipes that require above three uses of "Basic Synthesis".

Starting around level 30, you may start having trouble hitting 100% completion or 100% HQ on recipes.  It's important to check your gear as well as melds to make sure you have enough Craftsmanship/Control.

At 31, you gain "Basic Synthesis Mastery" which changes all of these macros which use "Basic Synthesis" by +20% for the progress multiplier.  That means the level 26 macro changes to "3.0x -> 3.6x" and "4.5x -> 5.4x".

## L26/D55 CP256 4.5x

There's room here to add one more "Basic Synthesis" to the end to use 65 durability, but increase the progress to a 5.5x multiplier.  Or you could add one more "Basic Touch" if you have another 18 CP above the required 256 CP.
