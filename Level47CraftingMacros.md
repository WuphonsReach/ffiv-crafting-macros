# Level 47

At level 47, you gain "Waste Not II".  Even at this level, you can continue to use the [Level 26 macros](Level26CraftingMacros.md) until you obtain "Byregot's Blessing" at level 50.

  - [L47/D30 CPxxx 3.6x](#l47d30-cpxxx-36x)

## L47/D30 CPxxx 3.6x

For recipes where a 3.6x multiplier is enough and you are at least 10-15 levels above the recipe, you probably have good enough gear to only need a double cycle of basic/standard touch.  

For recipes where a 1.8x multiplier is enough (you are 20+ levels above the recipe), you can continue to use the one from the [Level 26 macros](Level26CraftingMacros.md).
