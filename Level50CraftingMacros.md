## L50/D35 CP294 3.5x

This recipe is used to make HQ intermediates for 40 durability recipes.  While it can be used for Heavensward, there is a jump in difficulty from the level 47 recipes (~83) to the level 51 recipes (~110).  The level 52 recipes are another jump up to about ~130 difficulty and the level 54 recipes are about ~170 difficulty.

You will need about 300 Craftsmanship and 300 Control to start in on the Heavensward recipes.  Even then, you are going to need some HQ inputs, or some +Control buffs to get a reasonable HQ chance.
