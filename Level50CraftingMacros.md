# Level 50

At level 50, you gain "Byregot's Blessing".  However, you will need at least 294 CP in order to take advantage of it.  You will need about 300 Craftsmanship and 300 Control to start in on the Heavensward recipes.  Even at 300 Control, you are going to need some HQ inputs, or some +Control buffs to get a reasonable HQ chance. If your Craftsmanship skill is a little low, you may need to finish out with one more "Basic Synthesis".  In the mid 50s, you'll be shooting for 500-600 Craftsmanship/Control.

## L50/D55 CP312 5.3x

A full 15-step recipe that can be used once you meet the CP requirement.  It should work okay for level 52-59 recipes if you keep up with your +Control/+Craftsmanship melding and gear.  If you meld for +Control, you will frequently have to tack on another "Basic Synthesis".
