# Level 54

At level 54, you gain "[Muscle Memory](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Muscle_Memory)".  This is a powerful skill that gives you lots of Progress as the first two steps in your macro, with the downside that it can't be used for lower-level recipes (as it would immediately complete).  You can try to use "[Final Appraisal](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Final_Appraisal)" as the first step, but if you're using "Muscle Memory" then you probably need all fifteen steps for increasing quality/progress.

## L54/D75 CP286 10.7MM

A "Muscle Memory" macro that should get you through level 70.  Note that using it for stuff more then about 10 levels below your current level is risky as the progress bar may be completed on the first two steps.

In order to get 95%+ on the quality meter; you will need to keep your gear up to date (within 5-7 levels), use +Control consumables, slot for +Control and use at least one HQ input for some recipes.
