# Level 62

At level 62, you gain "[Careful Synthesis](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Careful_Synthesis)".  

What I've found in the level 60s is that you need your Craftsmanship to be around 1000 with level 61 crafting gear.  That can be a difficult number to hit unless you meld for Craftsmanship instead of Control.  Which means that obtaining a 100% HQ rate from NQ inputs is going to be very difficult.

The crafted level 63 or 65 gear will be needed before you can progress past the mid-60s recipes.

## L62/D55 CP333 6.7x

This is simply the "L50/D55 CP312 5.3x" macro, updated to use "[Careful Synthesis](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Careful_Synthesis)".  It uses a bit more CP, but boosts the progress multiplier to 6.7x.  This should work pretty well for recipes in the level 60s.

## L62/D75 CP325 10.4MM

A "Muscle Memory" macro that should get you through level 72.  Note that using it for stuff more then about 5-10 levels below your current level is risky as the progress bar may be completed on the first two steps.

In order to get 95%+ on the quality meter; you will need to keep your gear up to date (within 5-7 levels), use +Control consumables, slot for +Control and use at least one HQ input for some recipes.

## L62/D35 CP382 7.1x

A recipe for crafting ~690 difficulty pieces for when you only have ~950 craftsmanship.  This should give about an 84% HQ rate when combined with ~950 command.
