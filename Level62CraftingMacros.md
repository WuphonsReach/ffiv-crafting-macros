# Level 62

At level 62, you gain "[Careful Synthesis](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Careful_Synthesis)".  This shaves off one synthesis step from the "L54/D75 CP286 10.7MM" macro in exchange for one more "Basic Touch".

  - [L62/D75 CP325 10.4MM](#l62d75-cp325-104mm)

## L62/D55 CP333 6.7x

This is simply the "L50/D55 CP312 5.3x" macro, updated to use "[Careful Synthesis](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Careful_Synthesis)".  It uses a bit more CP, but boosts the progress multiplier to 6.7x.  This should work pretty well for recipes in the level 60s.

## L62/D75 CP325 10.4MM

A "Muscle Memory" macro that should get you through level 72.  Note that using it for stuff more then about 5-10 levels below your current level is risky as the progress bar may be completed on the first two steps.

In order to get 95%+ on the quality meter; you will need to keep your gear up to date (within 5-7 levels), use +Control consumables, slot for +Control and use at least one HQ input for some recipes.
