# Level 62

At level 62, you gain "[Careful Synthesis](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Careful_Synthesis)".  This shaves off one synthesis step from the "L54/D75 CP286 10.7MM" macro in exchange for one more "Basic Touch".

## L62/D75 CP325 10.4MM

A "Muscle Memory" macro that should get you through level 72.  Note that using it for stuff more then about 10 levels below your current level is risky as the progress bar may be completed on the first two steps.

In order to get 95%+ on the quality meter; you will need to keep your gear up to date (within 5-7 levels), use +Control consumables, slot for +Control and use at least one HQ input for some recipes.
