# Level 71

## L71/D70 CP420 9.7x

This is a good macro to use if you did not do the quest to unlock [Manipulation](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Manipulation) yet.  Maybe you don't have access to Kugane yet or haven't finished Heavensward.  It uses [Final Appraisal](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Final_Appraisal) which makes it safe even when [Muscle Memory](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Muscle_Memory) is used.  That's why the suffix is "x" instead of "MM".

```
/ac "Final Appraisal" <wait.2>
/ac "Muscle Memory" <wait.3>
/ac "Waste Not II" <wait.2>
/ac Innovation <wait.2>
/ac "Preparatory Touch" <wait.3>
