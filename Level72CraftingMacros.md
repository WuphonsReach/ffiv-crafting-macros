## L72/D30 CP467 7.5x

This recipe can be used for the level 81-87 Endwalker recipes.  You will probably need about ~2500 Craftsmanship and ~2500 Control. At level 86, with "Groundwork Mastery", the progress multiplier goes up to 8.4x.  Note that when making the level 88 recipes, the base HQ chance is only about 92-96% with ~2500 Control.  You'll need to bump up your +Control if you absolutely need 100% HQ from raw materials, or add one more quality step somewhere.

If you can get to 506 CP, consider moving up to one of the [Level 76 macros](Level76CraftingMacros.md).

## L72/D80 CP410 13.5x

This is a good macro to use if you did not do the quest to unlock [Manipulation](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Manipulation) yet.  Maybe you don't have access to Kugane yet or haven't finished Heavensward.  It uses [Final Appraisal](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Final_Appraisal) which makes it safe even when [Muscle Memory](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Muscle_Memory) is used.  That's why the suffix is "x" instead of "MM".

## L72/D80 CP455 14.3MM

Use this for the 2600-2900 difficulty recipes in EW for when you are not yet level 84 and don't have [Manipulation](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Manipulation) yet.  Note that it's marked with the "MM" suffix because it uses [Muscle Memory](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Muscle_Memory) without any protection.  Use it on too low of a recipe and you'll complete the synthesis on the 2nd step.
