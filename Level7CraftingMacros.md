# Level 7

Prior to level 7, you'll only have "Basic Synthesis" and "Basic Touch" (level 5).  There's not much point in creating macros for levels 1-6 since you will jump past them so fast.  However, once you have "Master's Mend" at level 7 it is worth trying to piece together something more advanced.  You're still too low to get 100% HQ on every combine as you would need all HQ inputs for the most part.
