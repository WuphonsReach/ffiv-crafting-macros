# Level 7

Prior to level 7, you'll only have "Basic Synthesis" and "Basic Touch" (level 5).  There's not much point in creating macros for levels 1-6 since you will jump past them so fast.  However, once you have "Master's Mend" at level 7 it is worth trying to piece together something more advanced.  

Now that Quick Synthesis giving full XP per craft, I recommend just using Quick Synthesis for bulk crafts.  There are a few recipes where having HQ inputs is useful to get a full 100% HQ result, but those are uncommon.  Most of the time you can get away with NQ inputs and have ~80% (or better) chance at a HQ result.

With most low-level crafting, if you want guaranteed HQ, improve the amount of control on your gear and/or level up some more.

If you really need a durability 30 or 40 macro at this level, just take one of these and drop one or two "Basic Touch" steps.
