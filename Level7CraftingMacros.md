# Level 7

Prior to level 7, you'll only have "Basic Synthesis" and "Basic Touch" (level 5).  There's not much point in creating macros for levels 1-6 since you will jump past them so fast.  However, once you have "Master's Mend" at level 7 it is worth trying to piece together something more advanced.  You're still too low to get 100% HQ on every combine as you would need all HQ inputs for the most part.

Now that it is so easy to get HQ outputs from NQ inputs at low levels, plus Quick Synthesis giving full XP per craft, I recommend just using Quick Synthesis for bulk crafts.

If you really need a durability 30 or 40 macro at this level, just take one of these and drop one or two "Basic Touch" steps.
