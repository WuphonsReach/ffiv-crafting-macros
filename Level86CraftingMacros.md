## L86/D75 CP506 21.1x

A macro for use from level 86-89 when trying to make level 90 recipes.  This works as long as you have at least 2400 Craftsmanship.  For the level 86-89 recipes you can keep using the [L76/D75 CP506 14.5x macro](Level76CraftingMacros.md).

Note: If you are level 89 and trying to make a level 90 recipe using level 80 Aethete's gear with only ~2500 Control then you will need to use all (or nearly) HQ inputs to get a guaranteed HQ result.  To get 100% HQ from all NQ inputs would require ~4100 Control with this macro.

Even some level 87-88 crafts will only have a 90-95% HQ rate with ~2500 Control.
